<objective>
Add a new integer phase to the end of the current milestone in the roadmap.

Routes to the add-phase workflow, which handles:
- Phase number calculation (next sequential integer)
- Directory creation and slug generation
- Roadmap structure updates
- STATE.md roadmap-evolution tracking
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.opencode/workflows/add-phase.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Argument: $ARGUMENTS (phase description)

The roadmap and state are resolved inside the workflow via `init phase-op` and targeted tool calls.
</context>

<process>
**Follow the add-phase workflow**, from `@.opencode/workflows/add-phase.md`.

That workflow handles all the logic, including:
1. Argument parsing and validation
2. Roadmap existence check
3. Current-milestone identification
4. Next-phase-number calculation (ignoring decimals)
5. Slug generation from the description
6. Phase directory creation
7. Roadmap entry insertion
8. STATE.md update
</process>
